## 💰 Escrow-Based Auction Settlement

Auction payments follow a **secure escrow flow**:

1. Buyer wins the auction  
2. Winning bid amount is deducted from buyer wallet  
3. Amount is held in **admin escrow wallet**  
4. After delivery confirmation:
   - Funds are released to the farmer  
5. In case of failure or dispute:
   - Amount is refunded to the buyer  

This ensures safety for both buyers and farmers.
